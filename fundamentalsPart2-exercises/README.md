# Assignment

To give you a good bit of practice, we have created some replit.com exercises for you to play with. We believe that it’s best to practice programming on your own computer, rather than in an online environment, but we’ll get to that soon enough.

Be sure to do the lessons in order presented here. Pressing “run” at the top will run the code. Read all directions, watch the terminal, and read all the errors. Don’t forget to use ‘console.log’ extensively.

To get started, create a free repl account and click “Fork” in order to have access to the exercises. Note: Feel free to browse the files on the left column in order to gain familiarity with it.
